USE Big Endianness.
USE ASCII.

For RigidObjects:

AAAA B C DDDD DDDD EEEE EEEE FF (GGGG GGGG)*F HH (IIII IIII)*H

A = Object ID (32 bits)
B = Texture name length (8 bit u int)
C = Texture name (Specified by B)
D = Position (2* 32 bit float)
E = Velocity (2* 32 bit float)
F = Amount of hitbox nodes (16 bit u int)
G = Node positions (2*E 32 bit float)
H = Amount of drawmodel nodes (16 bit u int)
I = Node positions (2*G 32 bit float)
